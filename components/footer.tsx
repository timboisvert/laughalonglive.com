          Laugh-Along, Live! is a monthly comedy show, movie screening, and party wrapped in one. Four comedians make
          jokes throughout a film (Ã  la Mystery Science Theater) and run activities for the audience. Audience
          participation is encouraged, as our shows often include drinking games, costume contests, trivia quizzes,
          dance-offs, and more. Follow us <a href="https://www.instagram.com/laughalonglive/">@laughalonglive</a> to
          know which movies we're doing next (after you've bought your tickets for this one, of course). Shows every
          third Friday and Saturday at Stars and Garters.
